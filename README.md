Introducing Gompressor, a simple and slow text-based file compressor written in go. 


## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How does it work?

The Gompressor's idea is simple: find occurrences in the content and replace them with references of the occurrences content(only if the variables size is smaller than the occurrence itself)

Here is a sample of a compressed content:
```
\e.txt\\d\world \d\hello \d\\o0\\o1\\o0\\o1\\o0\\o1\\o0\\o1\
```
The first variable is the **extension variable**, which will be used when we unzip the file.

 The format is like this: **``` \e[the file extension]\ ```**

 Then there are the *content variables*, which are sortet from the last to the beginning.

 The format is like this: **``` \d\[second variable content]\d\[first variable content]\d\```**

 When all the content variables finish, the content of the file starts which also contains the **content variables references** in their corresponding place.

 The format of the references is like this: **``` \o[index of the variable]\ ```**


 This is not the best way to compress a text file, but it works(expecially when the text file has too much occurrences eg. log files).

 The current implementation that I have done has some problems.

 First - it is very slow 

 Second - when the file has too much content sometimes the decompressor breaks the structure

 Third - works only with text based files
